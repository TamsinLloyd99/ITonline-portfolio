                Hello, I'm Tamsin, a passionate front-end web developer based in
                London. Formerly an primary school teacher, I made a
                significant career shift to pursue my interest in coding and design.
                Currently dedicated to refining my skills, I aspire to create
                engaging and user-friendly web experiences. My journey into the
                tech world has been fueled by a blend of curiosity and creativity.
                <br></br>
                When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me experimenting with
                new recipes in the kitchen, indulging in my love for crocheting,
                exploring pottery, or nurturing my ever-growing collection of
                indoor plants. Originally from the Orkney Isles, the connection to
                nature and my summers spent there have profoundly influenced my
                work. I strive to incorporate elements of simplicity, beauty, and
                functionality into my projects, creating digital landscapes that
                echo the wonders of the natural world. Feel free to explore my
                portfolio and get a glimpse of the unique blend of my teaching
                background and newfound tech skills. Let's connect and share our
                passions!</p>
